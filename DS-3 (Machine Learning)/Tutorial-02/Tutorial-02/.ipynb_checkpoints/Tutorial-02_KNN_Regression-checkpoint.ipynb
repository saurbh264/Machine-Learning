Unlike its classification counterpart, KNN regression predicts continuous values. The core idea behind KNN regression is to predict the target value of a new data point by averaging the values of its K nearest neighbors in the feature space. These \"neighbors\" are determined based on a chosen distance metric, such as Euclidean distance. The algorithm calculates the weighted average of the target values from these K neighbors, with closer neighbors having a stronger influence on the prediction."],"metadata":{"id":"igwN6CoyFMRd"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AY_k8FLRS9U0","outputId":"5fdbb519-2d34-4ba8-e425-18dfbc2000f4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1694970124275,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":47080,"user":{"displayName":"Rishab Shrinivas Bairi","userId":"03280586516765092693"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"Ow57AdzLPZ6_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1694970132079,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1781,"user":{"displayName":"Rishab Shrinivas Bairi","userId":"03280586516765092693"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor\n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score\n","import math"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/KNN/seeds.csv'\n","df = pd.read_csv(path)\n","\n","\n","\n","# Select the input features and target variable\n","X = df[[\"Area\", \"Perimeter\", \"Compactness\", \"Kernel.Length\", \"Kernel.Width\", \"Asymmetry.Coeff\", \"Kernel.Groove\"]]\n","y = df[\"Type\"]\n","# Load the dataset\n","# Load the dataset while skipping the header row\n","with open('/content/drive/MyDrive/KNN/seeds.csv', 'r') as file:\n","    data = file.readlines()[1:]\n","\n","data = [line.strip().split(',') for line in data]\n","\n","# Extract input features and target variable\n","X = [[float(x) for x in row[0:7]] for row in data]\n","y = [float(row[7]) for row in data]\n","\n","# Split the dataset into training and testing sets\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n","\n","# Initialize and train the KNN regression model\n","# Initialize and train the KNN regression model\n","k = 23# You can adjust the number of neighbors (K)\n","y_pred = []\n","\n","for x in X_test:\n","    distances = [((sum([(a -
